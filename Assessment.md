### Assessment Criteria

According to the assignment, the only code that you need to evaluate is in [cachematrix.R](cachematrix.R) which I have forked from the required repo and coded with copious notes.

Strictly speaking you are supposed to evaluate that code just by looking at it rather than running it. It should have a proper solution and that should be obvious from the coding style and the comments.

You should be able to tell that my code will work. In order for **ME** to be sure it would work I recreated the cachevector code and a test harness to run it (*so I know the example code was actual working code*) and I also created a test harness to make sure the cache vector code works as it is supposed to.

All those are extraneous files which I created to assist me in completing the assignment. You can look at them if you wish but those aren't supposed to enter into your peer assessment either positively or negatively.

**ENJOY!!**
